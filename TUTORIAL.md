## Reverse Engineering Code



## PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION 

This app allows users to create an account, log into the account and sign back out securely. All user data is stored in a mysql database.


## USER STORY

as someone who wants to safely log in to "X", I want to know my personal details are safely stored so that I donâ€™t have to worry about using "X".



## TECH USED 

-BCRYPTJS  <br>
-EXPRESS  <br>
-EXPRESS-SESSION <br>
-MYSQL2 <br>
-PASSPORT <br>
-PASSPORT-LOCAL <br>
-SEQUELIZE <br>

2)go into the config file, open config.js and insert your personal data ie username, password etc
3)open terminal in current repo and run "npm i" to install all node packages
4)In the Terminal run "node server.js" and you will successfully connect to server
5)Open browser and put "http://localhost:8080" in search bar
6)enjoy the app




## FILES EXPLAINED


CONFIG

MIDDLEWARE

isAuthenticated.js { 
restricts routes when the user is not logged in. If the user is logged in it will continue with request};

config.json { connection configuration to connect to server };


passport.js { contains javascript logic that tells passport we want to log in with an email address and password };


MODELS <br>
index.js { connects to database and imports users log in data };
user.js { requires "bcrypt" for password hashing. This makes our database secure even if compromised. Here we have JS that defines what is stored on our database };
 
 
ROUTES  <br>
api-routes.js { contains routes for signing in, logging out and getting users specific data to be displayed client side };
html-routes.js { routes that check whether user is signed in, whether user already has account etc and sends them tio the correct html page };
package.json { contains all package info, node modules used, version info etc };
server.js { requires packages, sets up PORT, creates express and middleware, creates routes and syncs database / logs message in terminal on successful connection to server };
